xxHash is an extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed limits.
It also successfully passes all tests from the SMHasher suite.

Q.Score is a measure of quality of the hash function.
It depends on successfully passing SMHasher test set.
10 is a perfect score.

A 64-bit version, named XXH64, is available since r35.
It offers much better speed, but for 64-bit applications only.

/*-**********************************************************************
*  XXH3
*  New experimental hash
************************************************************************/
#ifndef XXH_NO_LONG_LONG


/* ============================================
 * XXH3 is a new hash algorithm,
 * featuring vastly improved speed performance
 * for both small and large inputs.
 * A full speed analysis will be published,
 * it requires a lot more space than this comment can handle.
 * In general, expect XXH3 to run about ~2x faster on large inputs,
 * and >3x faster on small ones, though exact difference depend on platform.
 *
 * The algorithm is portable, will generate the same hash on all platforms.
 * It benefits greatly from vectorization units, but does not require it.
 *
 * XXH3 offers 2 variants, _64bits and _128bits.
 * When only 64 bits are needed, prefer calling the _64bits variant :
 * it reduces the amount of mixing, resulting in faster speed on small inputs.
 * It's also generally simpler to manipulate a scalar type than a struct.
 * Note : the low 64-bit field of the _128bits variant is the same as _64bits result.
 *
 * The XXH3 algorithm is still considered experimental.
 * It's possible to use it for ephemeral data, but avoid storing long-term values for later re-use.
 * While labelled experimental, the produced result can still change between versions.
 *
 * The API currently supports one-shot hashing only.
 * The full version will include streaming capability, and canonical representation
 * Long term optional feature may include custom secret keys, and secret key generation.
 *
 * There are still a number of opened questions that community can influence during the experimental period.
 * I'm trying to list a few of them below, though don't consider this list as complete.
 *
 * - 128-bits output type : currently defined as a structure of 2 64-bits fields.
 *                          That's because 128-bit values do not exist in C standard.
 *                          Note that it means that, at byte level, result is not identical depending on endianess.
 *                          However, at field level, they are identical on all platforms.
 *                          The canonical representation will solve the issue of identical byte-level representation across platforms,
 *                          which is necessary for serialization.
 *                          Would there be a better representation for a 128-bit hash result ?
 *                          Are the names of the inner 64-bit fields important ? Should they be changed ?
 *
 * - Canonical representation : for the 64-bit variant, canonical representation is the same as XXH64() (aka big-endian).
 *                          What should it be for the 128-bit variant ?
 *                          Since it's no longer a scalar value, big-endian representation is no longer an obvious choice.
 *                          One possibility : represent it as the concatenation of two 64-bits canonical representation (aka 2x big-endian)
 *                          Another one : represent it in the same order as natural order in the struct for little-endian platforms.
 *                                        Less consistent with existing convention for XXH32/XXH64, but may be more natural for little-endian platforms.
 *
 * - Associated functions for 128-bit hash : simple things, such as checking if 2 hashes are equal, become more difficult with struct.
 *                          Granted, it's not terribly difficult to create a comparator, but it's still a workload.
 *                          Would it be beneficial to declare and define a comparator function for XXH128_hash_t ?
 *                          Are there other operations on XXH128_hash_t which would be desirable ?
 *
 * - Variant compatibility : The low 64-bit field of the _128bits variant is the same as the result of _64bits.
 *                          This is not a compulsory behavior. It just felt that it "wouldn't hurt", and might even help in some (unidentified) cases.
 *                          But it might influence the design of XXH128_hash_t, in ways which may block other possibilities.
 *                          Good idea, bad idea ?
 *
 * - Seed type for 128-bits variant : currently, it's a single 64-bit value, like the 64-bit variant.
 *                          It could be argued that it's more logical to offer a 128-bit seed input parameter for a 128-bit hash.
 *                          Although it's also more difficult to use, since it requires to declare and pass a structure instead of a value.
 *                          It would either replace current choice, or add a new one.
 *                          Farmhash, for example, offers both variants (the 128-bits seed variant is called `doubleSeed`).
 *                          If both 64-bit and 128-bit seeds are possible, which variant should be called XXH128 ?
 *
 * - Result for len==0 : Currently, the result of hashing a zero-length input is the seed.
 *                          This mimics the behavior of a crc : in which case, a seed is effectively an accumulator, so it's not updated if input is empty.
 *                          Consequently, by default, when no seed specified, it returns zero. That part seems okay (it used to be a request for XXH32/XXH64).
 *                          But is it still fine to return the seed when the seed is non-zero ?
 *                          Are there use case which would depend on this behavior, or would prefer a mixing of the seed ?
