/*!
 * @mainpage xxHash
 *
 * xxHash is an extremely fast non-cryptographic hash algorithm, working at RAM speed
 * limits.
 *
 * It is proposed in four flavors, in three families:
 * 1. @ref XXH32_family
 *   - Classic 32-bit hash function. Simple, compact, and runs on almost all
 *     32-bit and 64-bit systems.
 * 2. @ref XXH64_family
 *   - Classic 64-bit adaptation of XXH32. Just as simple, and runs well on most
 *     64-bit systems (but _not_ 32-bit systems).
 * 3. @ref XXH3_family
 *   - Modern 64-bit and 128-bit hash function family which features improved
 *     strength and performance across the board, especially on smaller data.
 *     It benefits greatly from SIMD and 64-bit without requiring it.
 *
 * Benchmarks
 * ---
 * The reference system uses an Intel i7-9700K CPU, and runs Ubuntu x64 20.04.
 * The open source benchmark program is compiled with clang v10.0 using -O3 flag.

 * @note
 *   - Hashes which require a specific ISA extension are noted. SSE2 is also noted,
 *     even though it is mandatory on x64.
 *   - Hashes with an asterisk are cryptographic. Note that MD5 is non-cryptographic
 *     by modern standards.
 *   - Small data velocity is a rough average of algorithm's efficiency for small
 *     data. For more accurate information, see the wiki.
 *   - More benchmarks and strength tests are found on the wiki:
 *         https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/wiki
 *
 * Usage
 * ------
 * All xxHash variants use a similar API. Changing the algorithm is a trivial
 * substitution.
 *
 * @pre
 *    For functions which take an input and length parameter, the following
 *    requirements are assumed:
 *    - The range from [`input`, `input + length`) is valid, readable memory.
 *      - The only exception is if the `length` is `0`, `input` may be `NULL`.
 *    - For C++, the objects must have the *TriviallyCopyable* property, as the
 *      functions access bytes directly as if it was an array of `unsigned char`.
 *
 * @anchor single_shot_example
 * **Single Shot**
 *
 * These functions are stateless functions which hash a contiguous block of memory,
 * immediately returning the result. They are the easiest and usually the fastest
 * option.
 *
 * XXH32(), XXH64(), XXH3_64bits(), XXH3_128bits()
 *
 * @code{.c}
 *   #include <string.h>
 *   #include "xxhash.h"
 *
 *   // Example for a function which hashes a null terminated string with XXH32().
 *   XXH32_hash_t hash_string(const char* string, XXH32_hash_t seed)
 *   {
 *       // NULL pointers are only valid if the length is zero
 *       size_t length = (string == NULL) ? 0 : strlen(string);
 *       return XXH32(string, length, seed);
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @anchor streaming_example
 * **Streaming**
 *
 * These groups of functions allow incremental hashing of unknown size, even
 * more than what would fit in a size_t.
 *
 * XXH32_reset(), XXH64_reset(), XXH3_64bits_reset(), XXH3_128bits_reset()
 *
 * @code{.c}
 *   #include <stdio.h>
 *   #include <assert.h>
 *   #include "xxhash.h"
 *   // Example for a function which hashes a FILE incrementally with XXH3_64bits().
 *   XXH64_hash_t hashFile(FILE* f)
 *   {
 *       // Allocate a state struct. Do not just use malloc() or new.
 *       XXH3_state_t* state = XXH3_createState();
 *       assert(state != NULL && "Out of memory!");
 *       // Reset the state to start a new hashing session.
 *       XXH3_64bits_reset(state);
 *       char buffer[4096];
 *       size_t count;
 *       // Read the file in chunks
 *       while ((count = fread(buffer, 1, sizeof(buffer), f)) != 0) {
 *           // Run update() as many times as necessary to process the data
 *           XXH3_64bits_update(state, buffer, count);
 *       }
 *       // Retrieve the finalized hash. This will not change the state.
 *       XXH64_hash_t result = XXH3_64bits_digest(state);
 *       // Free the state. Do not use free().
 *       XXH3_freeState(state);
 *       return result;
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Streaming functions generate the xxHash value from an incremental input.
 * This method is slower than single-call functions, due to state management.
 * For small inputs, prefer `XXH32()` and `XXH64()`, which are better optimized.
 *
 * An XXH state must first be allocated using `XXH*_createState()`.
 *
 * Start a new hash by initializing the state with a seed using `XXH*_reset()`.
 *
 * Then, feed the hash state by calling `XXH*_update()` as many times as necessary.
 *
 * The function returns an error code, with 0 meaning OK, and any other value
 * meaning there is an error.
 *
 * Finally, a hash value can be produced anytime, by using `XXH*_digest()`.
 * This function returns the nn-bits hash as an int or long long.
 *
 * It's still possible to continue inserting input into the hash state after a
 * digest, and generate new hash values later on by invoking `XXH*_digest()`.
 *
 * When done, release the state using `XXH*_freeState()`.
 *
 *
 * @anchor canonical_representation_example
 * **Canonical Representation**
 *
 * The default return values from XXH functions are unsigned 32, 64 and 128 bit
 * integers.
 * This the simplest and fastest format for further post-processing.
 *
 * However, this leaves open the question of what is the order on the byte level,
 * since little and big endian conventions will store the same number differently.
 *
 * The canonical representation settles this issue by mandating big-endian
 * convention, the same convention as human-readable numbers (large digits first).
 *
 * When writing hash values to storage, sending them over a network, or printing
 * them, it's highly recommended to use the canonical representation to ensure
 * portability across a wider range of systems, present and future.
 *
 * The following functions allow transformation of hash values to and from
 * canonical format.
 *
 * XXH32_canonicalFromHash(), XXH32_hashFromCanonical(),
 * XXH64_canonicalFromHash(), XXH64_hashFromCanonical(),
 * XXH128_canonicalFromHash(), XXH128_hashFromCanonical(),
 *
 * @code{.c}
 *   #include <stdio.h>
 *   #include "xxhash.h"
 *
 *   // Example for a function which prints XXH32_hash_t in human readable format
 *   void printXxh32(XXH32_hash_t hash)
 *   {
 *       XXH32_canonical_t cano;
 *       XXH32_canonicalFromHash(&cano, hash);
 *       size_t i;
 *       for(i = 0; i < sizeof(cano.digest); ++i) {
 *           printf("%02x", cano.digest[i]);
 *       }
 *       printf("\n");
 *   }
 *
 *   // Example for a function which converts XXH32_canonical_t to XXH32_hash_t
 *   XXH32_hash_t convertCanonicalToXxh32(XXH32_canonical_t cano)
 *   {
 *       XXH32_hash_t hash = XXH32_hashFromCanonical(&cano);
 *       return hash;
 *   }
 * @endcode

 * Previously, implementation was hosted inside xxhash.c,
 * which was then #included when inlining was activated.
 * This construction created issues with a few build and install systems,
 * as it required xxhash.c to be stored in /include directory.
 *
 * xxHash implementation is now directly integrated within xxhash.h.
 * As a consequence, xxhash.c is no longer needed in /include.
 *
 * xxhash.c is still available and is still useful.
 * In a "normal" setup, when xxhash is not inlined,
 * xxhash.h only exposes the prototypes and public symbols,
 * while xxhash.c can be built into an object file xxhash.o
 * which can then be linked into the final binary.

 * @brief Controls how unaligned memory is accessed.
 *
 * By default, access to unaligned memory is controlled by `memcpy()`, which is
 * safe and portable.
 *
 * Unfortunately, on some target/compiler combinations, the generated assembly
 * is sub-optimal.
 *
 * The below switch allow selection of a different access method
 * in the search for improved performance.
 *
 * @par Possible options:
 *
 *  - `XXH_FORCE_MEMORY_ACCESS=0` (default): `memcpy`
 *   @par
 *     Use `memcpy()`. Safe and portable. Note that most modern compilers will
 *     eliminate the function call and treat it as an unaligned access.
 *
 *  - `XXH_FORCE_MEMORY_ACCESS=1`: `__attribute__((aligned(1)))`
 *   @par
 *     Depends on compiler extensions and is therefore not portable.
 *     This method is safe _if_ your compiler supports it,
 *     and *generally* as fast or faster than `memcpy`.
 *
 *  - `XXH_FORCE_MEMORY_ACCESS=2`: Direct cast
 *  @par
 *     Casts directly and dereferences. This method doesn't depend on the
 *     compiler, but it violates the C standard as it directly dereferences an
 *     unaligned pointer. It can generate buggy code on targets which do not
 *     support unaligned memory accesses, but in some circumstances, it's the
 *     only known way to get the most performance.
 *
 *  - `XXH_FORCE_MEMORY_ACCESS=3`: Byteshift
 *  @par
 *     Also portable. This can generate the best code on old compilers which don't
 *     inline small `memcpy()` calls, and it might also be faster on big-endian
 *     systems which lack a native byteswap instruction. However, some compilers
 *     will emit literal byteshifts even if the target supports unaligned access.
 *
 *
 * @warning
 *   Methods 1 and 2 rely on implementation-defined behavior. Use these with
 *   care, as what works on one compiler/platform/optimization level may cause
 *   another to read garbage data or even crash.
 *
 * See https://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2015/08/accessing-unaligned-memory.html for details.

 * @def XXH_SIZE_OPT
 * @brief Controls how much xxHash optimizes for size.
 *
 * xxHash, when compiled, tends to result in a rather large binary size. This
 * is mostly due to heavy usage to forced inlining and constant folding of the
 * @ref XXH3_family to increase performance.
 *
 * However, some developers prefer size over speed. This option can
 * significantly reduce the size of the generated code. When using the `-Os`
 * or `-Oz` options on GCC or Clang, this is defined to 1 by default,
 * otherwise it is defined to 0.
 *
 * Most of these size optimizations can be controlled manually.
 *
 * This is a number from 0-2.
 *  - `XXH_SIZE_OPT` == 0: Default. xxHash makes no size optimizations. Speed
 *    comes first.
 *  - `XXH_SIZE_OPT` == 1: Default for `-Os` and `-Oz`. xxHash is more
 *    conservative and disables hacks that increase code size. It implies the
 *    options @ref XXH_NO_INLINE_HINTS == 1, @ref XXH_FORCE_ALIGN_CHECK == 0,
 *    and @ref XXH3_NEON_LANES == 8 if they are not already defined.
 *  - `XXH_SIZE_OPT` == 2: xxHash tries to make itself as small as possible.
 *    Performance may cry. For example, the single shot functions just use the

 *
 * This is an important performance trick for architectures without decent
 * unaligned memory access performance.
 *
 * It checks for input alignment, and when conditions are met, uses a "fast
 * path" employing direct 32-bit/64-bit reads, resulting in _dramatically
 * faster_ read speed.
 *
 * The check costs one initial branch per hash, which is generally negligible,
 * but not zero.
 *
 * Moreover, it's not useful to generate an additional code path if memory
 * access uses the same instruction for both aligned and unaligned
 * addresses (e.g. x86 and aarch64).
 *
 * In these cases, the alignment check can be removed by setting this macro to 0.
 * Then the code will always use unaligned memory access.
 * Align check is automatically disabled on x86, x64, ARM64, and some ARM chips
 * which are platforms known to offer good unaligned memory accesses performance.
 *
 * It is also disabled by default when @ref XXH_SIZE_OPT >= 1.
