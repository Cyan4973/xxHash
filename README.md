xxHash - Extremely fast hash algorithm
======================================

xxHash is an Extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed limits.
It successfully completes the [SMHasher](http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/SMHasher) test suite 
which evaluates collision, dispersion and randomness qualities of hash functions.

Benchmarks
-------------------------

The benchmark uses SMHasher speed test, compiled with Visual 2010 on a Windows Seven 32-bits box.
The reference system uses a Core 2 Duo @3GHz

Q.Score is a measure of quality of the hash function.
It depends on successfully passing SMHasher test set.
10 is a perfect score.
Algorithms with a score < 5 are not listed on this table.

A new version, XXH64, has been created thanks to [Mathias Westerdahl]'s contribution, 
which offers superior speed and dispersion for 64-bits systems. 
Note however that 32-bits applications will still run faster using the 32-bits version.

SMHasher speed test, compiled using GCC 4.8.2, on Linux Mint 64-bits.
The reference system uses a Core i5-3340M @2.7GHz

| Version    | Speed on 64-bits | Speed on 32-bits |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| XXH64      | 13.8 GB/s        |  1.9 GB/s        |
| XXH32      |  6.8 GB/s        |  6.0 GB/s        |

This project also includes a command line utility, named `xxhsum`, offering similar features as `md5sum`, thanks to [Takayuki Matsuoka](https://github.com/t-mat) contributions.
